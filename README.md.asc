Monero Docker Image Arrangement
===============================

This is a set of a couple Docker images that I use to keep my Monero node and
Monero wallet organized. It started out as a fork of a Docker repository for
running a Monero full node, but now it also has a wallet and the goal is to
automate the set up of a self-hosted personal Monero system.
